## 3. How to install and run locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakubMiko/envirograph.git
cd envirograph
```

### 2. Setup backend (Ruby on Rails)

**Requirements:**
- Ruby (recommended: 3.3.5)
- Bundler (recommended 2.5.23)
- PostgreSQL (recommended 14.19)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd backend
bundle install
```

**Configure the database:**
- Make sure your local PostgreSQL server is running.
- By default, Rails uses `backend_development` for development and `backend_test` for tests (see `backend/config/database.yml`).
- Create and migrate the database:
  ```bash
  rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
  ```

**Start the backend server:**
```bash
rails server
```
By default, the backend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 3. Setup frontend (React)

**Requirements:**
- Node.js (recommended: 14.23)
- npm (recommended: 6.14.18)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Start the frontend:**
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

**Note:**
If you want to host the frontend separately (e.g. on Render, Vercel, Netlify), you need to set the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to your backend API address.
Locally, this variable is not required unless you run backend and frontend on different hosts/ports.

Example for deployment:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.onrender.com
```
